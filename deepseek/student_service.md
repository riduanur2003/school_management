## In Essence:
The Student Service acts as the **single source of truth** for anything related to student information. It's like a specialized librarian that only handles student records - other services ask it for student data instead of storing their own copies.

It follows the microservices principle of **single responsibility** - it does one thing (manage students) and does it well, without worrying about courses, enrollments, or other system aspects.
